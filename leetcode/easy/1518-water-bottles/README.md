# Water Bottles

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

There are `numBottles` water bottles that are initially full of water. You can exchange `numExchange` empty water bottles from the market with one full water bottle.

The operation of drinking a full water bottle turns it into an empty bottle.

Given the two integers `numBottles` and `numExchange`, return  *the  **maximum**  number of water bottles you can drink*.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: numBottles = 9, numExchange = 3
Output: 13
Explanation: You can exchange 3 empty bottles to get 1 full water bottle.
Number of water bottles you can drink: 9 + 3 + 1 = 13.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: numBottles = 15, numExchange = 4
Output: 19
Explanation: You can exchange 4 empty bottles to get 1 full water bottle. 
Number of water bottles you can drink: 15 + 3 + 1 = 19.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= numBottles <= 100
- 2 <= numExchange <= 100

        while(numBottles >= numExchange){
            int newBottles = numBottles / numExchange;
            int remBottles =  numBottles % numExchange;
            ans = ans + newBottles;
            numBottles = newBottles + remBottles;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
